## Overview

Personal Developments:

1. Implementing NextJS-

   NextJS features:-
   Server-side Rendering generates the initial HTML of the page on the server before sending it to the browser which allows the browser to display the layout while JavaScript is loading.

   Static Site Generation (SSG) that allows you to pre-render pages at build time and serve them as static HTML files.

   Server-side rendering also improves the SEO of the application.

   Routing: NextJs has built-in support for client-side routing, which can simplify the process of handling navigation in your application.

2. API integration:-

   Contenful API:
   Contentful is a headless Content Management System (CMS) that allows you to manage your content separately from your presentation layer.

## Built With

- React
- CSS Modules

## Features

1. Responsive UI: The website has implemented responsive UI components using CSS modules. This optimizes the website for varying screen sizes and platforms, ensuring that the website can be accessed from multiple devices and providing a consistent experience to users.

2. Reusable components: The use of CSS modules in the website enables reusability of UI components across multiple pages. This makes it easier to maintain and update the website.

3. Contentful API: The website is built using Contentful API, which allows for easy management of content such as products, blog posts, and pages. This enables the website owner to update the website's content and reducing the dependency on developers for content updates.
